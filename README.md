# Neural_Network_lib

In this project I created two dynamic libraries:
1. CSVdata.dll: For reading csv files
2. neuralnet.dll: For creating and training neural network

The dataset can be loaded from ./dataset folder and this folder also contains a simple python script to divide dataset into training and testing data. 

The header files for the libabries can be found in the ./lib folder.

The there is also a test.cpp that is used to train and test the neural network using the libraries
